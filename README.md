# auto_repo_archiver

**!! Work in progress !!**

Given a keyword, 

(1) pulls down related [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) papers 

(2) scans each page of each paper for [GitHub](https://github.com) URLs

(3) [wip] attempts to trigger the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to archive the repository.
